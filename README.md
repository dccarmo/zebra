# Zebra 2.0 (Android)

Boletos are a popular way to pay for things in Brazil, more commonly used to pay bills (rent, utilities, etc). Zebra is a boleto manager that allows you to scan a barcode and store the boleto in the app, create reminders to pay boletos and also get the boleto information whenever the user needs by opening a link.

This is the Android (and updated) version of the app I released in 2014. I worked on this app mostly to improve my React skills, and because of that it doesn't have any limit to use it's features.
